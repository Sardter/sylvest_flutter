# Sylvest Flutter

Sylvest is a social media platform that leverages Sylk Coin - a cryptocurrency coin - to enable users to gain crypto by the engagement they receive in the app.

The app features fundable projects which can be funded by the aforementioned crypto coin, a sophisticated event system that allows users to show the nearest and most relevant events, and modular posts that are comprised of several elements that support videos, images, and online links.

It also features role-based communities alongside a real-time chat feature.

This is the repository of the mobile front end of the application which compiles to both Android and IOS.
